## Installation
A user could download or clone the files from this repository, and once they've accessed the repo through their terminal they would run 'node index' to begin the prompts.    

## Usage
Once a user is prompted, they are asked for the text of their logo, which must be under 3 characters. They are then prompted for the text color, the shape of the logo- they are given the option of selecting a triangle, square, or circle, and the color of that shape. Once the prompts are complete, an svg file is written to the examples folder, and they can view their SVG file in any browser.
